You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath (Yeah)
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothing left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah

But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
